In this lesson, we are going to talk about setting up a basic web page. In `src/index.html` you will see the bare mininum needed to create a web page.

* You need to declare your document type: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
* You will need the `<html></html>` tags, this is where your HTML code will go.
* The `<head></head>` is where metadata and other information that describes the document itself will go.
* The  `<body></body>` is where the actual website content will go.

From there, there's a bit more structure you can add. Most websites have:
* A header to describe what the website is about or contain branding, etc.
* A navigation bar or section for the main links used to navigate the website
* A main section where the web page's main content is
* A footer where you can typically find supporting information like the company's address, social links, etc.

Your task for this lesson is the following:

1. Edit `src/index.html` to add a header, navigation section, main section and footer. (html)
2. In each section, simply type what the sections means in your own words. (html)
3. Save the changes (html)
4. Add the changes to a commit (git)
5. Commit the changes, don't forget to add a commit message (git)
6. Push the changes to GitHub (git)
