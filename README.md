Read this first: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp

In this lesson, you are going to do the following:
1. Create a new file in `src` called `about.html`
2. Create a new file in `src` called `contact.html`
3. In `src/index.html` in the navigation, add a unordered list of links, each link should point at one of the new files you've created. One link should say "About Me" on screen and point at the `src/about.html` file and the other should say "Contact Me" on screen and point at the `src/contact.html` file.
4. In the `about.html` file
   1. Add three paragraphs talking about yourself
      1. In each paragraph use the formatting elements listed here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp
   2. Add a link that says "Go Back" and takes you to the `index.html` page
5. In the `contact.html` file
   1. Write your favorite quote in a paragraph using the correct tag, ref: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quotation_elements.asp
   2. Leave me a special comment that only I can see on this page, ref: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp
   2. Add a link that says "Go Back" and takes you to the `index.html` page


**TIP:** You can copy and paste the `index.html` file and rename it.
