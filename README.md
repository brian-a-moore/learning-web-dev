# Lesson 1: Setting up your system

If you are here, that means you've already completed [Lesson 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jTldbT9miOZf93LpSaZKR7AQUXt7g3HCcTdZx6kyqtI/edit?usp=sharing) and have Node.js, VS Code, and Git installed on your machine and you have a GitHub account!

Congratulations!

This document is a called a "Read Me" document and it is written in a language called Markdown. You'll see documents like this a lot in coding and it is typically used to describe the code base you are in. I'll use `README.md` files often to give instructions of how to navigate your learning.

For each lesson you are going to create a new branch or checkout an existing branch based off of whatever lesson we are on. You will do the lesson locally on your machine and push your code back up to GitHub. I'll add new lessons periodically and you will need to use Git to check for new lessons, pull them down and do them.

Do not make changes to `main` directly.

When you're ready, go ahead and checkout the `lesson-02` branch to learn about Git!

**NOTE:** If you've installed all the extensions correctly, you should be able to right-click on the `README.md` file and click "Open Preview". Always open in preview so you can see the file pre-formatted and not look at the source code.
