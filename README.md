# Lesson 7: Block vs Inline

Read this first: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp

Your assignment for this lesson is to play around with block and inline elements in the `src/index.html` and write a comment in the HTML code describing 5-10 observations you've noticed about block and inline elements and their behavior.

It is very important you understand what is happening here, so if you are not 100% sure, we can have a meeting on this one. It is critial for your understanding going forward.

Essentially,

Block-level elements exist on their own line by default. 

Inline elements exist *in line* with its currrent element.

We kind of talked about this the other day when we talked about the difference between a `p` and `span` element. A `p` element will create its own line. A `span` element will operate in place without changing the rest of the structure of the document.
